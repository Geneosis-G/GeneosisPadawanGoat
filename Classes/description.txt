[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]As soon as I found a lightsaber in the Waste of Space map, I knew I had to make a mod like this one sone day :p So I added it to the planned list before people even had time to request it X)
First of all the lightsaber mutator is the core of this mod, and I think it's working exactly as intended: the controls used for it are exactly those I had in mind when I imagined the mod, and the lightsaber effect on things is really cool. The burning mark code was already included in the lightsaber item itself, but I modified it a bit to make it work on more surfaces and I added the break effect on explosive/breakable items.
About Jedi Goat and Sith Goat, any of you owning the Waste of Space DLC will recognize the Good Goat and Father Goat here ^^ In the beginning I was just planning to unlock those for people completing the objectives, but I noticed the original mutators were not working completely well on non-space maps. Also the controls to move the Force sphere around were a bit annoying, not really going where you want to go, so I ended up doing a modified version of these mutators. The modification do not change many things, but it allows you to move the Force field on any map (not only the space map) and to keep the Force where it is when you release the right click, allowing for more complex movements.
